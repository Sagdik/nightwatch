Why dev use Node?

As everyone know node js have came in huge demands by developer because its provide lots of benefits like :-

1.It makes building real-time apps (eg. chat or gaming) lightning fast.
2.It makes coding in JavaScript for both the client and server side possible.
3.It increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend developers (more on this later).
4.The ever-growing NPM (Node Package Manager) gives developers multiple tools and modules to use, thus further boosting their productivity
5.Code executes faster than in any other language.
6.Node is perfect for microservices which are a popular solution among enterprise apps.

So working on Web Automation Testing based on node js mainly recommended to use node related frameworks.In this there is lots of testing framework come in market like(mocha JS,Jasmine,AVA,JEST,Karma,Chai JS and Nightwatch).

We choose Nightwatch here because its full End to End framework . Nightwatch.js is a Selenium wrapper that provides several out-of-the-box commands and assertions for performing various operations on the page.

What is NightWatchJS?

Nightwatch.js is an integrated, easy to use End-to-End testing solution for web applications and websites, written in Node.js. It uses the W3C WebDriver API to drive browsers in order to perform commands and assertions on DOM elements. Its come with some benefits as per official site:-

Selenium Server : Manages automatically Selenium or WebDriver services (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, Edge, Safari) in a separate child process.

Fluent and easy to work with Page Object Model support to better organise elements and sections, with support for both CSS or Xpath selectors.

Clean syntax : Simple but powerful syntax which enables you to write tests very quickly, using only Javascript (Node.js) and CSS or Xpath selectors.

Reporting : JUnit XML reporting is built-in so you can integrate your tests in your build process with systems such as Teamcity, Jenkins, Hudson etc.

Easy to extend :Flexible command and assertion framework which makes it easy to extend to implement your application custom commands and assertions.

Cloud Services Support : Works with cloud testing providers, such as SauceLabs and BrowserStack.
